 Task A -> Priority 6 TaskB ->Priority 5 TaskC -> Priority 3, Task A has ReRunMe(3) and  TaskB has ReRunMe(1) 
Main:
QueTask(taskA);
QueTask(taskB);
QueTask(taskC); 


Output:
Size of ready queue is 20 therefore we are demonstrating the output for 20 ticks
Since TaskA has the highest priority, it was executed first. Following it was TaskB since it had the second highest priority. Finally TaskC with the least priority.
TaskA has ReRunMe(3) so it is put in the delay queue for 3 clock ticks and Task(B) has ReRunMe (1) so it is put in the delay queue for 1 clock tick. 
Since TaskB is dequeued from the delay queue and enqueued in the ready queue before TaskA it is executed before it.
