# cooperative-scheduler-renode
This project is developed to be a cooperative scheduler for embedded systems and the code must be developed using Keil uVison IDE and run on the STM32F4_discovery kit simulated using Renode. 

## Steps for building and running the project:							<br/>	(given that you already have Keil uVison IDE and Renode installed on your computer)<br/>

1- Download the “main.c” file <br/>
2-  Follow the instructions in the “Renode Example Guide.pdf” file in the repo to create a new project, add packs for the STM32F4 microcontroller, and run the code on renode.  <br/>
3- The output should be as "app1.png" <br/>
